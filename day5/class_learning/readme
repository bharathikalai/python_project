#object 
#what is object 
# object is a thing that you can see or touch in the real world
# it could be a car a person  or even a piece of cake
# if you have a toy car that toy car is an object it has certain 
# properties like color size and speed


#class 

#what is class 

#classes are like blueprints or templates for creating objects they defind 

# a class is like a blue print or recipe to create objects
# imagin you have a blueprint for making toy car this blueprints tells you 
# what a toy car should look like and what it can do 

# it specifies the property like color and size and action like move 
# and stop that every toy car made using this blueprint will have

# object = something you can touch or interact with (like a toy car)
# class = blueprint or recipe to create object (like the instruction for making toy cars)




# Inheritance

# inheritance in programming allow a new class (child class) to inherit attributes
#                                               and method 
#                                               form existing class 
#                                               this is called inheritance)
#type of class 
#parent class
# child class




#encapsulation

# imagine you have a tresure chest inside this tresure chest you keep your 
# valuable items safe form others the teasure chest have a lock on it and only you have the key to open it 


# treasure chest :  this is like a class its a container the holds your data(like variables)
# and methods like function

#valuable items : these are like the data(attributes ) you wan to keep safe and organized

#lock and key : this represents encapsulation  the lock protects the treasure chest class and methos allow you to access and manipultate the data safely



#polymorphism



# polymorphism  in programming means that diffrent classes or object can respond
# to the same method or function in their own unique way
